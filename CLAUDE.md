## Project Overview
- Marketing site for Claude Code, targeting Product Marketing Managers (PMMs)
- Goal: convince non-technical PMMs that Claude Code is a force multiplier for their marketing work, not a "developer tool"

## Tech Stack
- Single-page site built with **plain HTML and inline CSS** — no frameworks, no build step
- Just open `index.html` in a browser to preview

## Persona & Copy Guidelines
- The target buyer persona is defined in `persona.md` — **always reference it before writing or editing any copy**
- Lead with marketing outcomes (faster launches, fewer bottlenecks, more control) — never lead with technical features
- Use the persona's language: "edit your site", "ship a landing page", "update competitive pages" — avoid dev jargon like repos, PRs, commits
- Frame Claude Code as a marketing team tool, not a developer tool she's borrowing
