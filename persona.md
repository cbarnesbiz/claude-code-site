# Target Buyer Persona

## Profile

- **Role:** Product Marketing Manager (PMM)
- **Company stage:** Series B SaaS
- **Experience:** 3-5 years in product marketing
- **AI familiarity:** Uses ChatGPT daily for writing and research; has not explored AI coding tools

## Key Priorities

- **Pipeline contribution:** Directly tied to demand gen metrics; needs marketing programs that convert
- **Competitive intel:** Constantly tracking competitor positioning, feature launches, and pricing moves
- **Content velocity:** Under pressure to ship landing pages, case studies, one-pagers, and sales enablement faster than headcount allows

## Mindset & Objections

- Skeptical that AI coding tools are relevant for non-engineers
- Thinks "coding tool" means "for developers" and self-selects out
- Comfortable with AI for text generation but draws a hard line at anything that touches code
- Needs to see a use case framed in her language (campaigns, launches, pages) not engineering language (repos, PRs, builds)

## What Would Change Her Mind

- Seeing a PMM peer use Claude Code to ship a landing page without filing a ticket
- A demo that starts from a marketing goal, not a technical one
- Proof that she can update competitive comparison pages herself instead of waiting on the dev queue
- Framing the tool as "work directly with your website" rather than "write code"

## Messaging Implications

- Lead with outcomes she already cares about: faster launches, fewer bottlenecks, more control
- Avoid jargon: say "edit your site" not "commit to a repo"
- Position Claude Code as a force multiplier for the marketing team, not a developer tool she's borrowing
- Use social proof from non-engineering roles to build credibility
